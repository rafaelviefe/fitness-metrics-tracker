# Project Roadmap

[x] ID: 020: Create the `src/features/weight/components/AddWeightForm.tsx` file with a basic React functional component structure and export it.

[x] ID: 022: In `src/features/weight/components/AddWeightForm.tsx`, import the `Input` component and add a self-closing `<Input />` element within the component's JSX.
[x] ID: 023: In `src/features/weight/components/AddWeightForm.tsx`, import the `Button` component and add a `<Button>` element with the text "Add Weight" within the component's JSX.
[ ] ID: 024: In `src/app/page.tsx`, import the `AddWeightForm` component and render it within the main section, before the "Your Weight Records" section.
[ ] ID: 025: In `src/features/weight/components/AddWeightForm.test.tsx`, add a test to verify that the `Input` and `Button` components are rendered inside the `AddWeightForm`.
